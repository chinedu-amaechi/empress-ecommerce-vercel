                Empress Canada has launched! We have been in business for 10+
                years over seas and we now aim to bring our designs to jewelry
                fans across the world. In collaboration with a highly
                experienced jewelry artisan based in China — who has already
                achieved significant success in the local market — we are now
                expanding our reach into North America, introducing our elegant
                designs to a new audience.

                Founded in 2015 by Ting Ting Yan, Empress began as a pursuit of
                perfection in the art of bracelet making. What started as a
                small studio in TT's home has grown into an atelier celebrated
                for its distinctive designs and uncompromising quality.

                Each collection tells a unique story, inspired by TT's deep
                appreciation for diverse cultural heritages. From the ethereal
                delicacy of our Celestial Bloom series to the bold statements of
                our Heritage line, every piece carries the unmistakable Empress
                signature.
